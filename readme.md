Pearto player is a Music player built using *only* raylib! It runs using around ~130mb of ram and ~40mb of vram, which is *blazingly* fast. All of this with a really amateurish C code base with probably 80 CVEs, take that real developers! "Optimized" for AMD A6 3400M processors.

<br>I am not rewriting this in Rust. (Atleast not for now)
